# Conway's Game of Life in C++ v2 with headers

## Overview
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells that evolve through generations based on a set of simple rules.

## Features
- High-performance C++ implementation.
- Configurable grid size and rules.
- File-based input and output options.
- Visual representation of the simulation.

## Getting Started
